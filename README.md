## üéØ Introduction
The Periospot Quiz is an engaging and dynamic web application tailored for dental professionals seeking to evaluate and enhance their knowledge in specialized fields such as implant dentistry and periodontics. This educational tool serves a dual purpose: it not only gauges the proficiency levels of its users through a series of carefully curated questions but also offers personalized content recommendations based on their quiz performance.

The quiz experience is designed to be both informative and enjoyable, presenting an innovative approach for dentists to self-assess their expertise. Upon completion, participants are provided with a score that accurately reflects their current understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, the application intelligently suggests relevant educational materials that align with the user's scoring bracket.

There are three distinct outcomes catered to varying levels of expertise: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Each outcome directs the user to a unique landing page, which showcases tailored content designed to elevate their dental practice to the next level. Beginners who score below a certain threshold receive resources that lay down foundational knowledge, intermediates are guided towards content that builds upon their existing skills, and advanced users are offered in-depth material to delve deeper into the complexities of implant dentistry and periodontics.

This approach ensures that every dental professional, regardless of their initial skill level, is given a clear path for professional growth and learning. The Periospot Quiz not only stands as a testament to interactive learning but also as a beacon for continuous professional development in the ever-evolving world of dental medicine.

Typography
The quiz interface employs a clean and straightforward typographical approach to ensure clarity and ease of reading:

Arial Black: Utilized for headings to capture attention and convey significance.
Arial: The primary typeface for questions and content, offering a balance between readability and information density.
Sans-serif: Used for supplementary text, providing a modern and clean aesthetic that complements the primary typefaces.
This combination of typefaces ensures a hierarchical structure that guides users naturally through the quiz flow, from questions to answers and results.

## Technology Stack
- HTML (index.html, scorehigh.html, scorelow.html, scoremedium.html)
- CSS (styles.css)
- JavaScript (main.js, score.js)


## Testing

To ensure a robust and error-free user experience, extensive testing has been conducted across all components of the Periospot Quiz application. The following tests and validators have been used to verify the integrity and standards compliance of the codebase:

Validator Testing

### HTML Validation:

The HTML code of the application, including index.html, scorehigh.html, scorelow.html, and scoremedium.html, has been tested using the Official W3C Markup Validator. The validator confirmed that all documents were checked and found to have no errors or warnings, ensuring adherence to web standards and compatibility across browsers.

![HTML Validation Result](documentation/wec.png)



### CSS Validation:

The stylesheet styles.css passed through the Official W3C CSS Validator for CSS level 3 + SVG. The validator returned a congratulatory message, indicating no errors were found, which confirms the quality and standards-compliance of the CSS code.

![CSS Validation Result](documentation/w3ccss.png)


### JavaScript Validation:

The JavaScript code was validated using the Official Jshint Validator, configured for ES6 syntax. The validator returned the following metrics:

28 functions in the file.
The function with the largest signature takes 1 argument.
The largest function contains 31 statements.
The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity of 3.
While 37 warnings were reported, these were related to the use of ES6 features such as arrow functions, let, and const, which are standard in modern JavaScript development. As the application is intended for environments where ES6 support is available, these warnings do not affect the functionality and have been acknowledged for future reference.



### Testing Conclusion

The successful passing of the code through various validators without errors or warnings is a testament to the meticulous development process and adherence to modern web standards. This ensures that Periospot Quiz delivers a consistent and reliable user experience.

During the manual testing phase, a few bugs were identified and subsequently fixed:

- Keyboard Navigation: An issue with keyboard navigation flow was identified and not solved. There is a conflic in the js file not solved. 




### 6. Bugs and Resolutions

#### Encountered Issues and Resolutions

**Issue 1:** Unchecked runtime.lastError: Encountered in Chrome DevTools, indicating that the message port closed before a response was received.
   - **Resolution:** Disabled all browser extensions and then re-enabled them one by one. Identified that a specific extension was causing the issue, which was then kept disabled.

**Issue 2:** Page Refresh on Start: The quiz page refreshed when the "Start" button was clicked, which was caused by the default behavior of the `<input type="submit">` within a form.
   - **Resolution:** Changed the button type to `<input type="button">` to prevent form submission and page refresh.

**Issue 3:** Username Input Validation: The validateUserInput() function incorrectly flagged three-character usernames as invalid due to a zero-based index count.
   - **Resolution:** Adjusted the validation logic to account for the index starting at zero.


#### Bugs Left Unfixed

**Bug 1:** Image Responsiveness: Certain images, including GIFs, were not displaying properly across all screen sizes, causing layout issues.
   - **Current Status:** Adjusted image sizes and ensured responsiveness, which solved the issue for most cases. Ongoing adjustments for optimal display across all devices.

**Bug 2:** Enter Key Navigation: The application does not progress to the next page upon pressing the Enter key.
   - **Current Status:** Investigating the main.js file to identify and resolve the underlying cause.

**Bug 3:** Element Alignment and Responsiveness: Aligning elements, particularly for different types of answers (GIFs, images, text), was challenging to maintain a consistent and responsive design.
   - **Current Status:** Achieved a uniform look after several iterations and fine-tuning.


**Bug 4:** iOS VoiceOver on Score Display: VoiceOver on iOS does not read from the first element on the Score Display.
   - **Current Status:** Requires additional testing and research for a solution.

#### Manual Testing Bug Fixes

**Fix 1:** Hidden Radio Buttons: During manual testing, hidden radio buttons were included in the keyboard navigation sequence.
   - **Resolution:** Applied display:none to visually hidden elements, removing them from the tab order and screen readers.


**Fix 2:** Inconsistent Button Styling on iOS: The 'Start' button styling was inconsistent due to iOS default styles.
   - **Resolution:** Overrode default iOS styling with custom CSS to match the design of other buttons.

**Fix 3:** Radio Button Label Visibility on iOS: Selected radio button labels were difficult to read due to hover/focus styles.
   - **Resolution:** Modified CSS to improve text readability and removed hover styles for mobile devices.
